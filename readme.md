updating an A record in a cpanel dns zone editor via a dyndns client

copy config.php and update.php and .htaccess into ./nic in a subdomain created to host the update files. eg. ddns.example.ca

update config.php with your username/pass.  cpServer is the url you use to access cpanel. port is usually 2083
authUsers/pass is same as above for me.
authHostnames is the A record you wish to update
these can all be comma seperated to update multiple records. user/pass must also be in multiple even if they are the same.

used https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DynamicDNS  to set up ddclient on my local server.  
`sudo nano /etc/ddclient.conf`

my config file looks like this
``` 
#Configuration file for ddclient generated by debconf
#
#/etc/ddclient.conf

daemon=3600
use=web, web=checkip.dyndns.com/, web-skip='Current IP Address: '
protocol=dyndns2
server=ddns.example.ca
login=user
password='pass'
server.example.ca

```
run `sudo ddclient -daemon=0 -debug -verbose -noquiet` to check
